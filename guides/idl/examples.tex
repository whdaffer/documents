\section{Examples}\label{sec:examples}

  \item Create an array of latitudes running from -90 to 90 in 1 degree
  increments

    \IDL{lats=findgen(181)-90}

  \item Same as above, but in 1/2 degree increments

    \IDL{lats=findgen(181*2)/(2*181-1)*180-90)}

  \item  Create two 2-d index arrays, one for longitude, one for
  latitude, on 1 degree grids, so that the longitudes run along the rows
  and the latitudes along the columns (in the IDL usage of those words)

    \IDL{lats=replicate(1.,360)\#(findgen(181)-90)}

    \IDL{lons=findgen(360)\#replicate(1.,181)}

  \item reform an array from a 2 d (M by N) to a vector having the same
  number of elements

   Let A by the M by N array, then 

      \IDL{A = reform(A,M*N)}

  \item Create an array which is created from 2-d array A (M by N) but
  which is a*M by b*N


     \IDL{B = rebin(A, a*M, b*N)}


  \item Take a 2d array A (M by N) and turn it into a 3d array (M by N
  by L) in which eac of the M by N sub-arrays is merely a copy of the
  original A

      \IDL{B = rebin( A, M, N, L)}

  \item Find the data in an array meeting certain conditions

  Assume you have a 1 degree grid of some sort of geophysical data
  Data (181 by 360) and you want all the data between -40 south and 40 north
  where Data is not equal to some sentinel value BadData

   first create the latitude index array

   \IDL{lats=(findgen(181)-90)\#replicate(1.,360)}

  Now use \textit{where} with a compound statement conditioning of
  \textit{lats} and \textit{Data}

   \IDL{bad=where(data ne baddata and abs(lats) le 40,nbad, complement=good, ncomp=ngood )}

   Parcel the data up into its good and bad parts.

   \IDL{bad\_data = data[bad]}

   \IDL{data=data[good]}

    You should probably check the quantities \textit{nbad} and
    \textit{ngood} first.
