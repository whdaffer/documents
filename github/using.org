You get put files into git, but if you want to be able to access them
from anywhere, you need to put them into something like github.com.

1) You need an account github.com. Go create one. It's free if you're
   not doing anything too big or for profit
2) You need to get your files into git. Then into github. This
   involves connecting a local git repository to something on github.

Start here: https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/

* Creating the local git repository is a triviality. 

Generally you want to organize things into 'projects' which have some
related functionality or pupose. You can then create the git
respository in the topmost directory and it will all be added. 

Use the following example. I have some documentation in LaTeX which I
want to put on github so that I can make it available to me on any of
my machines (desktop, laptop, iPad, iPhone). These are the steps I
used. Mostly this is commentary on the link above, which I found to
have some maddening gaps which I had to fill in.

My directory structure looks like this. The '...' means 'some
directory tree above `documents'

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

... documents --+
                          |
                         + guides --------- + 
                          |                          |
                          |                          + idl
                         + manuals
#+END_SRC


(The '%' is the shell prompt! Don't type it)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  % cd ... documents
  % git init -b main # this creates documents/.git
   % git add .          # adds all the files from documents on down
   % git commit .    # commits the changes. 
#+END_SRC

  At `git commit' you'll be asked to add a log message. The manner by
  which you do that depends on the environment (e.g. are you one a
  Windows machine? A Mac? Linux?) so all I'm going to say about that
  is, type in whatever message you want (or just exit, a blank message
  is okay) and exit the dialog however you must (if on Linux and you
  haven't configured an editor, the default if `vi', so use , ':q' (no
  quotes) to exit without saving a log message, or type 'i' to go into
  `insert' mode, type a messages, the 'Esc' to quit insert and 'ZZ' to
  save and quit)

  Okay, you have a *local* git repository. Now we have to get it into github.
  

* Getting files into github


  First, if you haven't done it, create a github account.  You can't
  do anything without that.

  To get files into github you have to set up a repository at
  github.com somehow and then tell your local git repository to use
  the one on github. YOu must also `authenticate' yourself to github,
  essentially `log in'

  There is supposed to be some command-line github scripting
  named *gh* that allows you to do these things, but, as of today
  [2021-10-22 Fri] it hasn't worked.  

  It is entirely possible that this is my fault, but I don't have time
  to work it out when I have a work around.

  There are two ways to authenticate to github: SSH and HTTPS. For the
  latter you need to get a token from github. I tried this and
  couldn't make it work (again, as of [2021-10-22 Fri]), so I went
  with using SSH.

  To use that approach, do the following. Log onto your github
  account, click on the little world icon at the top right, click
  settings, then `SSH and GPG Keys' in the right-hand toolbar. Then
  get whichever ssh-key you want to use (I'm on linux, so I'll be
  doing this with shell commands. *Mutatis Mutandis*

  (BTW, I made a new key and gave it a passphrase. If you have a
  non-empty passphrase you'll have to authenticate with the github
  server, I believe once each session (haven't gotten that far yet.)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  % cat ~/.ssh/<you-ssh-key-file-here.pub>

  # copy the whole line

#+END_SRC

  Then paste what you copied above into the appropriate box. If it's an
  SSH key, paste it into the SSH box. If a GPG key, into the GPG box.

  Now, test it. Do

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  % git -T git@github.com

   # If it says....


'Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
not provide shell access.'

  # You're in!

#+END_SRC

  Now we need a repository on github! Later on, we'll connect the
  local one to the `remote' on on github.com.

  1. Logged onto my https://github.com account and created a new repository there.
  2. Created at new repository. I used the name of the parent
     directory: 'documents' in this case.


#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#+END_SRC


  You have to authenticate with github. T
* Setting up github repository 
* git command line
* gh command line
* github you on
